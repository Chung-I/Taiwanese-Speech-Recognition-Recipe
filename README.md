### Welcome to the demo recipe of the Formosa Speech Recognition Challenge 2020 (FSR-2020)

Formosa Speech Recognition Challenge 2020 (FSR-2020) is the second event of the Formosa Speech in the Wild (FSW) project, which is organized by Taipei University of Technology (NTUT).  
Taiwanese (a.k.a. Taiwanese Hokkien, Hoklo, Taigi, Southern Min or Min-Nan) is a language spoken natively by about 70% of the population of Taiwan. Although the number of Taiwanese speakers still continues to drop, especially among the youth generations, it's not yet too late to save this language. Therefore, we are now calling for and welcome participants from both academic and industrial sectors to FSR-2020. Students are especially welcomed to participate for the competition for the Student Award.

This recipe is based on the "TAT-Vol1-train" corpus (about 40 hours). For more details, please visit:
